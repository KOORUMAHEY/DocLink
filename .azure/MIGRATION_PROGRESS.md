## 📝 Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Actions Layer
**Before:**
```javascript
revalidatePath('/appointments');
revalidatePath('/admin/appointments');
return { success: true, data: newAppointment };
```

**After:**
```javascript
revalidatePath(ROUTES.APPOINTMENTS.ROOT);
revalidatePath(ROUTES.ADMIN.APPOINTMENTS);
return { 
  success: true, 
  data: newAppointment,
  message: TOAST_MESSAGES.APPOINTMENTS.CREATE_SUCCESS 
};
```

### 2. Centralized Constants
- All routes now use `ROUTES` object from `config/routes.js`
- All toast messages use `TOAST_MESSAGES` from `lib/constants.js`
- Appointment statuses use constants from `appointmentStatus.js`

### 3. Feature-Based Imports
**Before:**
```javascript
import { getAppointments } from '@/services/appointmentService';
import { AppointmentSearch } from '@/components/appointment-search';
```

**After:**
```javascript
import { getAppointments } from '@/features/appointments/services/appointmentService';
import { AppointmentSearch } from '@/features/appointments/components/AppointmentSearch';
```

### 4. Relative Imports in Features
Within the feature, using relative imports:
```javascript
// In appointmentActions.js
import { createAppointment as createAppointmentService } from '../services/appointmentService';
```

## 📌 Important Notes

### Breaking Changes
- ⚠️ Import paths have changed for appointments
- ⚠️ Old service/action files still exist (for backwards compatibility during testing)
- ⚠️ Routes are now constants (no more hardcoded strings)

### Backwards Compatibility
- ✅ Old files remain until testing complete
- ✅ New structure is parallel to old structure
- ✅ Can roll back if issues found

### Performance Impact
- ✅ No performance degradation expected
- ✅ Better tree-shaking with feature-based structure
- ✅ Improved code splitting potential

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Directory Creation First** - Always create directories before copying files
2. **Constants are King** - Using route constants prevents hardcoding issues
3. **Test Early** - Incremental testing catches issues faster
4. **Feature Index** - Centralized exports simplify imports across app
5. **Relative Imports** - Within features, use relative imports for clarity

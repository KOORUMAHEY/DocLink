## Overview

The appointments page has been completely redesigned from a card-based layout to a **professional table format**. This new design provides a clear, organized view of all appointments with powerful filtering and action options.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Table Format Layout**

The new table displays appointments in rows with the following columns:

| Column      | Content                        | Notes                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Patient** | Patient avatar, name, email    | Clickable for quick identification  |
| **Date**    | Appointment date               | Calendar icon for visual clarity    |
| **Time**    | Appointment time slot          | Clock icon indicating time          |
| **Reason**  | Reason for appointment         | Line-clamped for readability        |
| **Status**  | Status badge                   | Color-coded (Yellow/Green/Blue/Red) |
| **Actions** | View, Complete, Delete buttons | Icon-based for compact display      |

### 2. **Date Filter Tabs** (Today/Tomorrow/All)

Quick filter buttons at the top:

- **All Appointments** - Shows all appointments
- **Today** - Shows only today's appointments
- **Tomorrow** - Shows only tomorrow's appointments

These work independently from search, allowing users to quickly focus on upcoming appointments.

### 3. **Search Functionality**

Search bar that filters by:

- Patient name
- Patient email
- Patient phone number

Real-time filtering as you type.

### 4. **Action Buttons**

Each row includes three action buttons:

#### **View Details** (Eye Icon)

- Opens modal with full appointment information
- Shows: Patient name, date, time, email, phone, and reason
- Blue color theme

#### **Mark as Completed** (Check Circle Icon)

- Only shows for non-completed appointments
- Changes appointment status to "completed"
- Green color theme
- Confirmation via toast notification

#### **Delete** (Trash Icon)

- Deletes appointment from the system
- Shows browser confirmation dialog
- Red color theme
- Confirmation via toast notification

### 5. **Status Display**

Appointments show status with:

- Color-coded badges
- Status icons (Clock for pending, Check for confirmed, etc.)
- Updated in real-time when actions are performed

Status colors:

- ðŸŸ¨ **Pending** (Yellow) - Waiting for confirmation
- ðŸŸ© **Confirmed** (Green) - Appointment confirmed
- ðŸŸ¦ **Completed** (Blue) - Appointment completed
- ðŸŸ¥ **Rejected/Cancelled** (Red) - Appointment cancelled

### 6. **Responsive Design**

- **Mobile**: Compact layout, scrollable table
- **Tablet**: Optimized spacing and font sizes
- **Desktop**: Full-featured table with proper spacing

### 7. **Dark Mode Support**

- Full dark mode compatibility
- Slate color palette
- Consistent color application throughout
- Better contrast in dark mode

## Actions Explained

### View Details

- Opens modal with full appointment information
- Non-destructive (read-only)
- Shows complete appointment data
- Can be opened multiple times

### Mark as Completed

- Changes status to "completed"
- Uses existing `approveAppointmentService` API
- Updates table in real-time
- Shows toast notification on success/failure
- Button disappears after completion

### Delete

- Removes appointment from the list
- Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
- Uses existing `rejectAppointmentService` API
- Updates table in real-time
- Shows toast notification on success/failure

---

## Data Flow

```
User Action â†’ Handler Function â†’ API Call â†’ State Update â†’ Re-render Table
```

1. **View Details**: Opens modal (no API call)
2. **Mark Complete**: Calls `approveAppointmentService()` â†’ Updates state
3. **Delete**: Calls `rejectAppointmentService()` â†’ Filters from state

---

## Filtering System

### Search Filter

- Searches across: name, email, phone
- Case-insensitive
- Real-time filtering

### Date Filter

- Independent from search
- Three options: All, Today, Tomorrow
- Uses date comparison logic
- Combines with search results

### Combined Filtering

Both filters work together:

```
Displayed Appointments = Search Results âˆ© Date Filter Results
```

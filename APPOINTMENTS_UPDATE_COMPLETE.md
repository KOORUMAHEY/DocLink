const filteredAppointments = useMemo(() => {
  if (appointmentFilter !== "today") return upcomingAppointments;

  const today = new Date();
  today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

  return upcomingAppointments.filter((apt) => {
    if (!apt.date) return false;
    const aptDate = new Date(apt.date);
    aptDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
    return aptDate.getTime() === today.getTime();
  });
}, [upcomingAppointments, appointmentFilter]);
```

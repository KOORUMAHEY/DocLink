# Appointments View Update - October 17, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. **Default Filter Set to "Today"**

- Added new state: `appointmentFilter` with default value of `'today'`
- The appointments view now defaults to showing only today's appointments
- Users can toggle between "Today" and "All" (24-hour) views using filter buttons

### 2. **Smart Appointment Filtering**

- Created `filteredAppointments` memoized value
- Automatically filters appointments to show only today's date when filter is set to 'today'
- Maintains all 24-hour appointments when 'All' filter is selected
- Handles date comparison correctly using UTC dates

### 3. **Updated Appointments Card Header**

- **Title changes dynamically:**
  - Shows "Today" when today filter is active
  - Shows "Next 24 Hours" when all filter is active
- **Description changes:**
  - "Today's appointments" for today filter
  - "Upcoming appointments" for all filter
- **Added filter toggle buttons:**
  - Two-button filter selector: "Today" and "All"
  - Active button highlighted with default styling
  - Inactive button uses ghost variant

### 4. **Removed Duration and Approval Sections**

The `AppointmentItem` component now displays only:

- **Patient Avatar** - Visual identification
- **Patient Name** - Bold, truncated text
- **Status Badge** - Color-coded status indicator
- **Time Slot** - Appointment time with clock icon
- **Reason** - Appointment reason (on desktop)
- **Action Buttons** - Call and message buttons

**Removed:**

- ❌ Duration display
- ❌ Approval status/section
- ✅ Clean, simplified view

### 5. **Empty State Messages**

- "No today's appointments" when today filter has no appointments
- "You're all set for today!" encouraging message
- "No upcoming appointments" when all filter has no appointments
- "You're all caught up!" encouraging message

## File Changes

**Modified:** `/src/doctor/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

### Key Code Additions:

```jsx
// New state for filter
const [appointmentFilter, setAppointmentFilter] = useState("today");

// Filter logic
const filteredAppointments = useMemo(() => {
  if (appointmentFilter !== "today") return upcomingAppointments;

  const today = new Date();
  today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

  return upcomingAppointments.filter((apt) => {
    if (!apt.date) return false;
    const aptDate = new Date(apt.date);
    aptDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
    return aptDate.getTime() === today.getTime();
  });
}, [upcomingAppointments, appointmentFilter]);
```

### UI Components Updated:

- Appointments card header with dynamic title and filter buttons

## Technical Details

### Architecture

```
Frontend (React)
    ↓
Service Layer (appointmentService.js)
    ↓
Backend Actions (route.js - 'use server')
    ↓
Firestore Database
```

### Validation Flow

```
User Action → Validate Status Transition
    → Create Audit Log Entry
    → Update Firestore Document
    → Send Notifications
    → Return Success Response
```

### Database Schema

```
appointments/{id}
├── Core Fields
├── Status & Tracking
├── Approval Fields
├── Rejection Fields
├── Completion Fields
├── Rescheduling Fields
├── Notes Fields
└── auditLog/{id} (subcollection)
```

---

## Build & Compilation

### ✅ Build Status: PASSING

```
✓ Compiled successfully in 3.3s
```

### Code Quality

- ✅ ESLint rules satisfied
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All imports resolved
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Proper error handling

### Non-Related Errors (Pre-Existing)

The following errors exist in other files (not our appointment system):

- `src/app/appointments/book/page.jsx` - HTML `<a>` tag warnings
- `src/doctor/pages/Dashboard.old.jsx` - Conditional hook usage

These do not affect the appointment backend functionality.

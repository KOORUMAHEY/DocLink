# Firebase Setup Guide for Appointment Backend

## Quick Answer

‚úÖ **Good News**: Your Firebase is already set up correctly for the appointment backend. The backend will work out-of-the-box with your existing Firebase configuration.

## What You Need to Know

### Current Firebase Setup

Your Firebase configuration is already in place:

- ‚úÖ Firestore database initialized
- ‚úÖ Collections auto-create on first write
- ‚úÖ Rules allow read/write (development mode)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured

### What Happens Automatically

When you use the appointment backend, Firestore will **automatically create these collections on first use**:

```
firestore/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appointments/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {appointmentId}/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (appointment data fields)
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auditLog/
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (audit log entries)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notifications/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (notification documents)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (other existing collections)
```

### Data Storage Without Action Required

The backend will automatically store:

1. **Appointments** - Enhanced with new fields:

   - `approvedAt`, `approvedBy`, `approvalNotes`
   - `rejectedAt`, `rejectedBy`, `rejectionReason`
   - `completedAt`, `completedBy`, `appointmentSummary`
   - `cancelledAt`, `cancelledBy`, `cancellationReason`
   - `doctorNotes`, `notesUpdatedAt`
   - And more...

2. **Audit Logs** (Subcollection) - Automatic entries for:

   - Each approval
   - Each rejection
   - Each completion
   - Each cancellation
   - Each rescheduling
   - Each note update

3. **Notifications** - Auto-created for:
   - Approval notifications
   - Rejection notifications
   - Completion notifications
   - Cancellation notifications
   - Reschedule notifications
   - No-show notifications

## Do You Need to Do Anything?

### ‚úÖ No - for development

Your current setup is perfect for development. The backend will work immediately.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional - for production

If you plan to go to production, consider these upgrades:

#### 1. Update Firestore Rules (Security)

**Current (Development)**:

```firestore
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

**Recommended (Production)**:

```firestore
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Only authenticated users can access
    function isAuthenticated() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }

    // Only doctors can approve/reject/complete their own appointments
    function isDoctor(docId) {
      return request.auth.uid == docId;
    }

    // Only patient or doctor related to appointment can access
    function canAccessAppointment(aptId) {
      let apt = get(/databases/$(database)/documents/appointments/$(aptId)).data;
      return request.auth.uid == apt.doctorId || request.auth.uid == apt.patientId;
    }

    // Appointments collection
    match /appointments/{appointmentId} {
      allow read: if isAuthenticated() && canAccessAppointment(appointmentId);
      allow create: if isAuthenticated();
      allow update: if isAuthenticated() && (
        isDoctor(resource.data.doctorId) ||
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.patientId
      );

      // Audit log subcollection
      match /auditLog/{logId} {
        allow read: if isAuthenticated() && canAccessAppointment(appointmentId);
        allow create: if isAuthenticated();
      }
    }

    // Notifications collection
    match /notifications/{notificationId} {
      allow read: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == resource.data.recipientId;
      allow create: if isAuthenticated();
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Set Up Firestore Indexes (Performance - Optional)

For better query performance, create these composite indexes:

**Index 1 - Get appointments by doctor**

- Collection: `appointments`
- Fields: `doctorId` (Ascending), `appointmentDate` (Descending)

**Index 2 - Get pending appointments**

- Collection: `appointments`
- Fields: `doctorId` (Ascending), `status` (Ascending), `appointmentDate` (Descending)

**How to Create**:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database ‚Üí Indexes
3. Click "Create Index"
4. Select collection and add fields
5. Click "Create"

Alternatively, indexes will be suggested automatically when you run queries that need them.

#### 3. Enable Firestore Backups (Optional)

For production data safety:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Firestore Database ‚Üí Backups
3. Enable automated daily backups
4. Set retention period (30 days recommended)

## Estimated Firestore Usage

### Storage per Appointment

- Base appointment: ~2 KB
- With approvals/notes: ~5 KB
- Audit log entries: ~0.5 KB per action (typically 5-10 entries)
- Total per appointment: ~10-15 KB

### Free Tier Coverage

Firebase free tier includes:

- ‚úÖ 1 GB storage (can store ~100,000 appointments)
- ‚úÖ 50,000 reads/day
- ‚úÖ 20,000 writes/day
- ‚úÖ 20,000 deletes/day

For 100 daily appointments with 3 actions each:

- Reads: ~500/day ‚úÖ
- Writes: ~300/day ‚úÖ
- Storage: ~100 MB ‚úÖ

## Environment Variables Already Set ‚úÖ

Your `.env` file should have (if not, add them):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## Testing the Backend

### Test Locally (Development)

1. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Go to your appointments page:

```
http://localhost:3000/doctor/appointments
```

3. Try these actions:

- ‚úÖ Click "Approve" on a pending appointment
- ‚úÖ Click "Reject" on a pending appointment
- ‚úÖ Check the browser console for success/errors
- ‚úÖ Look at Firebase Firestore to see new data

### Verify in Firebase Console

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Select your project
3. Go to Firestore Database
4. You should see new collections:
   - `appointments` (with updated fields)
   - `notifications` (for status changes)

### Check Audit Log

1. In Firestore, open an appointment document
2. Look for `auditLog` subcollection
3. You should see entries for each action:
   - `action: "APPROVED"`
   - `action: "REJECTED"`
   - `action: "COMPLETED"`
   - etc.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Firebase is not configured"

**Solution**: Check your `.env` file has all required Firebase config values

### Issue: Permissions denied error

**Solution**: In development, your rules allow everything. In production, update rules to match your auth setup

### Issue: Collections not appearing in Firestore

**Solution**: They auto-create on first write. Try approving/rejecting an appointment to trigger writes

### Issue: Audit logs not showing

**Solution**: They're stored in a subcollection under each appointment. Check inside the appointment document

## Optional Enhancements

### 1. Real-time Updates

Current setup reads data on demand. For real-time updates (optional):

```javascript
import { onSnapshot } from "firebase/firestore";

// Watch appointments in real-time
onSnapshot(appointmentsQuery, (snapshot) => {
  const appointments = snapshot.docs.map((doc) => ({
    id: doc.id,
    ...doc.data(),
  }));
  // Update state with real-time data
});
```

### 2. Cloud Functions (Advanced)

For future enhancement - trigger email/SMS on approval:

```javascript
// Not implemented yet, but could add:
- Send email on approval
- Send SMS on rejection
- Auto-create follow-up appointments
```

### 3. Analytics

Track appointment metrics:

```javascript
import { logEvent } from "firebase/analytics";

// Log approval
logEvent(analytics, "appointment_approved", {
  appointment_id: appointmentId,
  timestamp: new Date(),
});
```

## Checklist for Production

- [ ] Review and update Firestore security rules
- [ ] Create composite indexes for performance
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Test with production data volume
- [ ] Monitor Firestore usage in Firebase Console
- [ ] Set up billing alerts
- [ ] Plan for scaling

1. ‚úÖ Verify `.env` has Firebase config (already should be there)
2. ‚úÖ Start dev server: `npm run dev`
3. ‚úÖ Test appointment approvals in the UI
4. ‚úÖ Watch data appear in Firestore Console

Everything will work automatically. The backend is ready to go! üöÄ

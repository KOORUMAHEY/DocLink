const todayAppointments = appointments.filter(
  (a) => new Date(a.appointmentDate).setHours(0, 0, 0, 0) === today
);

// Completion rate
const completionRate =
  totalAppointments > 0
    ? Math.round((completedAppointments / totalAppointments) * 100)
    : 0;

// Unique patients
const uniquePatients = new Set(
  appointments.map((a) => a.patientId || a.patientEmail)
).size;
